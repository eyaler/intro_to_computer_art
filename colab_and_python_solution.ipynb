        "* Make sure you are connected to the internet\n",
        "* Make sure you are logged in to a google account\n",
        "* Runtime (top menu) -> Restart runtime\n",
        "* Runtime (top menu) -> Factory reset runtime\n",
        "* Ctrl+F5 (on Mac: Shift+Cmd+R) (you will lose any unsaved work)\n",
        "* Close and reopen the tab (you will lose any unsaved work)\n",
        "* Close and reopen the browser (you will lose any unsaved work)\n",
        "* Press the small drop-down arrow on the top right (left of Editing) and click Connect to a hosted runtime\n",
        "* If you are not using a latest chrome or firefox please try using one of them\n",
        "* Try to disable any add-ons changing web content, e.g. auto-translators, aggressive ad-blockers, javascript blockers, privacy add-ons, etc. If you are not sure you can try a fresh install of the browser (or a different browser)\n",
        "* Try another computer?\n",
        "2. If you hit a \"Too many sessions\" error, select Manage session from the pop up or from the top menu Runtime -> Manage sessions, and click Terminate other sessions on the bottom left. Note that just closing the tab may not be enough.\n",
        "3. If you are opening a notebook shared by someone else, and you want to save it you need to click Copy to Drive (just below the runtime menu)\n",
        "4. If you get a \"Syntax Error\" when running code, this means you wrote something wrong. Go back to the original notebook shared with you by refeshing the tab or reopening the link. Make sure you are following the same usage of spaces, newline, letter case, punctuation, etc.\n",
        "5. If you still have issues try to Google it!"
